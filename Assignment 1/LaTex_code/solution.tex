\textbf{Q4(a):}
What must be subtracted from $16x^3-8x^2+4x+7$ so that the resulting expression has $2x+1$ as a factor?\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Let $p(x)=16x^3-8x^2+4x+7$ and $d(x)=2x+1$.\\
Polynomial division of $p(x)$ with $d(x)$:\\
\\
$\polylongdiv{16x^3-8x^2+4x+7}{2x+1}$
\\
\\
From the above division, it is clear that 1 has to be subtracted from the polynomial $p(x)$, so that $d(x)$ becomes factor of the resulting polynomial after subtraction.
\\
\\
Using remainder theorem:\\
Remainder theorem states that remainder of division of a polynomial $f(x)$ by a linear polynomial $x-r$ is equal to $f(r)$.So, remainder of $p(x)$ divided by $d(x)$ is $p(\frac{-1}{2})$.
\\
\begin{align}
      p(\frac{-1}{2}) &= 16(\frac{-1}{2})^3-8(\frac{-1}{2})^2+4(\frac{-1}{2})      +7
      \\
      &= 1
\end{align}
So, subtracting 1 from the given polynomial $p(x)$ gives a polynomial which has $d(x)$ as its factor.
