\section{Question}
\begin{frame}{Question}
4 cards are drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. What is the probability of obtaining 3 diamonds and one spade?
\end{frame}


\section{Solution}
\begin{frame}{Solution}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the events defined as follows,\\
	$X$ : Picking three diamond cards \\
	$Y$ : Picking a spade card
\end{frame}

\section{For $X$}
\begin{frame}{For $X$}
Number of possible ways of choosing three diamonds from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is given by,
   \begin{align}
        n(X) &= {13 \choose 3}
   \end{align}
\end{frame}
 
\section{For $Y$}
\begin{frame}{For $X$}
Number of possible ways of choosing one spade from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is given by,
   \begin{align}
        n(Y) &= {13 \choose 1}
   \end{align}
\end{frame}   

\section{Sample Space}
\begin{frame}{Sample Space}
Number of possible ways of choosing four cards from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is given by,
   \begin{align}
        n(S) &= {52 \choose 4}
   \end{align}
\end{frame}  

\section{Solving}
\begin{frame}{Solving}
Number of possible ways of choosing three diamonds and one spade from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is given by,
   \begin{align}
        n(X Y) &= {13 \choose 3} \times {13 \choose 1}
   \end{align}
Probability of getting 3 diamonds and 1 spade is given by,
	\begin{align}
	\pr{X Y} &= \frac{n(X Y)}{n(S)} \\
	&= \frac{{13 \choose 3} \times {13 \choose 1}}{{52 \choose 4}} \\
	&= \frac{3178}{270725} \\
	&= 0.0137
	\end{align}
Therefore, the probability of getting 3 diamonds and 1 spade is 0.0137.
